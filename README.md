# PreciseMovement-library
## About
The PreciseMover (PreMo) library available for the Arduino uses the pure pursuit algorithm for easy path following for differential drive robots. 

The pure pursuit algorithm is a robust algorithm, which has been used for path following since the 1980s. The algorithm in various forms are used anywhere from robots to autonomous vehicles.

The library also features methods to move the robot in specified movements: forward or reverse by a certain distance, and turn or twist by a certain angle. 

The library was developed in the Computer Aided Design and Innovation Lab at Stony Brook University.
